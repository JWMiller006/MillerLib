/* 
 * This File is the start of the Miller Library
 * 
 * The Miller Library is a simple library that 
 *  was started January 2025 in order to include
 *  examples and functions for different use 
 *  cases. As more information is learned, these
 *  functions will be updated to try to make 
 *  them the most efficient while also being the
 *  most secure. Since the catalyst for creating
 *  this library was a Computer Science class 
 *  which limits the C Langeuage Version to 
 *  C Standard 90, I will be using that and 
 *  optimizing for the UMD Grace Server. That 
 *  being said, the CMake version is also limited
 *  to CMake 2.8.
